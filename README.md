# ical-parser

Wrapper web app for the [PHP ics-parser](https://github.com/u01jmg3/ics-parser) library.

Intended to be a (more or less) self-hosted imitation of the [icalendar.org IoT Calendar Service](https://icalendar.org/iot.html), so that either could be used to power my [E-Ink Calendar](https://github.com/clockspot/eink-calendar).
